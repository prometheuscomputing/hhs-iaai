title: About Prometheus

The use of emerging and innovative technologies is a critical piece to supporting the creation of an agile, sustainable and efficient government that will be able to handle the needs and hopes of the current and future generations. However, these technologies need to be leveraged in the right context under the right circumstances in order to maximize the return on investment. Rapid development coupled with enterprise considerations (Rapid Enterprise Development) allows the testing of new or existing technologies to create innovative, disruptive or enhanced solutions that has the potential to transform government functions.

Prometheus Computing has been working on the intersection of new technologies and their
application in the federal government since its inception in 2008. Prometheus Computing has a great team of professionals who are passionate about technologies and strive to find innovative ways to apply them to new ideas. 

Prometheus has been using this pool of talent with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as its primary client to move concepts from thoughts to ideas to concepts to designs to prototypes to fully-fledged systems that are used in and out of NIST.

During the development of innovative solutions with NIST, Prometheus Computing has been
using a series of rapid development techniques in order to deliver small versions of usable solutions to the stakeholders, to get feedback, maybe fail fast and early and adjust appropriately to increase the value to the end-user community.

Furthermore, Prometheus Computing is cognizant of the fact that these innovative technologies, if successful, would ultimately become part of the Agency's infrastructure which mean that throughout the innovation process, Prometheus is looking at how operational conditions will impact of be impacted by the IAAI solution.
